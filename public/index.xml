      <description>While most cities use a variety of measures to control traffic, including speed limits, one-way streets, stop signs, and traffic lights, St. Louis has used wholesale closures of roadways since the 1970s to prevent traffic from flowing freely through many of the city&amp;rsquo;s neighborhoods. A &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; interesction of two streets with two-way traffic looks something like this:  Cars approaching the intersection slow and stop, and then have the ability to go straight or turn right or left (as long as there are no signs preventing, for example, no left-hand turns).</description>

      <description>Interactive Map Use the map below to explore the locations of current and former barriers in St. Louis. The numbered map symbols indicate the total number of points being “clustered” together to make the map easier to read when zoomed out. You can click on them to zoom into that area and reveal individual barriers. If you find an intersection that is missing a barrier, or see a closed intersection that is now open, please let us know!</description>
