      <description>While most cities use a variety of measures to control traffic, including speed limits, one-way streets, stop signs, and traffic lights, cars remain generally free to make turns at intersections (as long as there are no signs preventing, for example, no left-hand turns). A &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; intersection of two streets with two-way traffic looks something like this:  This configuration is what we will refer to as an &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; street grid, where traffic is generally un-restricted in terms of the ability to turn at intersections.</description>

      <description>Interactive Map Use the map below to explore the locations of current and former barriers in St. Louis. The numbered map symbols indicate the total number of points being “clustered” together to make the map easier to read when zoomed out. You can click on them to zoom into that area and reveal individual barriers. If you find an intersection that is missing a barrier, or see a closed intersection that is now open, please let us know via email or by opening an issue on our GitHub page!</description>
