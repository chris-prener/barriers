While most cities use a variety of measures to control traffic, including speed limits, one-way streets, stop signs, and traffic lights, St. Louis has used wholesale closures of roadways since the 1970s to prevent traffic from flowing freely through many of the city's neighborhoods. A "typical" interesction of two streets with two-way traffic looks something like this:
<p> </p>

Cars approaching the intersection slow and stop, and then have the ability to go straight or turn right or left (as long as there are no signs preventing, for example, no left-hand turns). This configuration is what we will refer to as an "open" street grid, where traffic is generally un-restricted in terms of the ability to turn at intersections.

## Defining Barriers
Beginning in the 1970s, the City's local legislative body known as the [Board of Alderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Aldermen_of_the_City_of_St._Louis) - its version of a City Council - began authorizing the installation of barriers around the city. As these number of closures has increased, we have moved in many neighborhoods from having an "open" street grid where traffic flows easily to having a "closed" street grid with some neighborhoods becoming increasingly difficult to navigate. In our research, we define a closure as:

> Any physical barrier installed on a temporary or permanent basis that closes a roadway to at least one direction of travel. New roadway construction that achieves the same is also treated as a closure.

## General Types of Barriers
Keep in mind that these closures were never systematically tracked or planned by City officials. However, they do follow a number of patterns in their design and installation. The first two types listed below, simple closures and cul-de-sacs, are by far the most common types of barriers in the city. The others on this list occur with far less frequency.

### 1. Simple Closure
One of the most common configurations involves a set of either concrete or metal obstacles placed across one street at an intersection so that vehicles on the closed street must make a u-turn, and no traffic on the other streets can traverse the closed street:

The materials used for these closures include concrete balls, jersey barriers, concrete planters known as "Schoemehl Pots" (named for a former mayor of St. Louis), and metal and brick gates. An example of "Schoemehl Pots" can be found at barrier 198, found at the intersection of Enright Avenue and North Newstead Avenue in the Vandeventer neighborhood:

### 2. Cul-De-Sac
Another common configuration of closure involves the construction of cul-de-sacs. The implications for traffic flow are the same as with simple closures, with traffic on the closed street forced to make a u-turn in the cul-de-sac and traffic on the other streets unable to traverse the closed street:

An example of this type of closure is barrier 130, found at the intersection of Botanical Avenue and Tower Grove Avenue in the Shaw neighborhood:
<p> </p>

A variation of these occurs on some streets that only would have a three way intersection, so traffic on the cross street is forced to continue driving straight rather than having the option to turn left or right onto the closed street.

### 3. Small Parks
In some cases, closures have been used to create [pocket parks](). The impact of these is the same as both simple closures and cul-de-sacs, but the land use is different. Whereas cul-de-sacs may have a few small plantings, the pocket parks involve far more square feet and more extensive landscaping. These increase the greenspace in a neighborhood by occupying a larger space between the intersection the (typically) a cul-de-sac than other closures:

These small parks take on different forms, with orinmental plantings being more common. However, there is at least one example of these being used as a community vegetable gardern. This can be seen at barrier 178 in the Central West End:

### 4. Larger Parks
In a few cases, larger parks have been built that transform an existing street or ally into a park for several blocks. This has the effect of occluding traffic both on the former street, but also on cross streets that are barricaded on either side of the park itself:

An example of this type of closure is the [Ruth C. Porter Park]() in...

### 5. Multiple Closures
In some cases, we see multiple closures at a single intersection. The more common way in which these are installed is to close two opposite sides of an intersection so that traffic can proceed uninhibited on a cross street but cannot turn down either block of the closed street. On both sides of the intersection, traffic on the closed street must make a u-turn instead of being able to turn onto the cross street:

Occasionally, however, we see barriers installed both streets so that traffic is forced to turn either right or left, depending on the original direction of travel:

### 6. Partial Closures
At a small number of intersections, we see what we describe as partial closures. These take on a number of different forms. At a handful of locations, there are closures that do not close off any of the intersecting streets completely. However, the barrier itself cuts across the entirety of the intersection at a 45-degree angle, forcing cars to turn from one street to the other:
